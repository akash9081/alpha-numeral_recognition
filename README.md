# alpha-numeral_recognition

INTRODUCTION

There are many areas where alphabet and digit recognition systems are widely used.
The modern day techniques used for this task is of the deep learning domain. The
advent of deep learning has really revolutionized this area of recognition systems.
Detection using convolutional neural networks is really popular these days. This has
really led to some fascinating breakthroughs. The model we have created is also a
model based on Convolutional Neural Networks.

One of the most important tasks in the process of creating a deep learning model is the
task of data collection and dataset generation that generally takes the lion’s share of
time in a real world deep learning project. Therefore we need to have some efficient
ways to harvest the data. Data crawling that we have used is one such technique. We
have shown its utility in the course of the project that one can find in the main body of
the report.

Next we have techniques like data augmentation that helps us when the dataset is
small. We have also used it in training our model and found good results from it.
After creating any model, deploying it is most important if we look at it from a product
point of view. So we try to do exactly that in the form of a basic web application that
might not look stellar like real world products, but still serves the purpose


OBJECTIVE

The objective of the work done by us can be summarised into following few points:

● Building a recognition system for English alphabets and digits.

● Creating the dataset and filtering it.

● Using techniques like in-place data augmentation to enhance the diversity of the
dataset.

● Finding out the optimal parameters and hyperparameters for the model.

● Deploying the model in the form of a web application
